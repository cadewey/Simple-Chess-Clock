### Please note

For a number of reasons, I have not touched this app in quite some time and it has been de-listed from the Play Store, so it should be considered
unsupported/abandoned. Anyone who would like to use this code in their own projects is more than welcome to do so, but unfortunately I do not
forsee myself returning to this code and it very well may not function properly on newer devices/Android versions/etc.

## Simple Chess Clock

Simple Chess Clock does what it says! It is designed for touchscreen Android devices, and provides a simple, clear interface and easy interaction. Planned features include:

 - Configurable player times
 - Delays, Fischer Time
 - Sound alerts

...and more!
